## Inspiration
After quarantine has begun, I felt that it is hard to keep tracking what I eat daily basis. Therefore, I decided to create an App that can easily track part of nutritions by displaying all essential information on one screen without requiring to scroll. It may not be precise, but I focused on easy usage.

## What it does
By entering an item name with quantity, it automatically sums up calories, carbs, protein, fat, and fibre then displays into the graph. Also, it allows the users to maintain appropriate nutrition amount by displaying five different levels -Very Low, Low, Appropriate, High, and Very High- next to the legend. If an entered item is not found from the API, the user can manually enter the item.
At the left top corner, there is hamburger navigation. The user can navigate to Approx BMR calculator page. This page allows the user to estimate their BMR based on their gender, age, weight, and height. 

## Challenges I ran into
Since It is a solo project; there is a limit that I can make within the provided time frame (23.5 hr). It was hard to prioritize the features. Also, It was hard to maintain the maximum concentration during this entire given time. 

## What I've learned
I've learned how to use React hooks and minimal pie chart better. 

## What's next for NuTrack
I am planning to add an authentication feature hooked with a backend so, the data will persist, and it will provide a user to track better.
In the future, a user will be able to track the daily, monthly, and yearly health results and view the results through the line graph. Also, based on the approx BMR entered, the user could calculate his own performance. 

## Built With
